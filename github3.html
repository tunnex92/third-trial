<p> <a name="rainforest alliance"> 	<strong>TRACEABILITY PROGRAM: </strong>
<br> Our goals are</br>
To ensure that Born to win is recognized in the international cocoa market as a leading supplier of quality cocoa.
<br>We will ensure that our traceability programme assures buyers that they are consuming products produced using socially and environmentally responsible processes that are backed by Rainforest Alliance Certified™ certification.
<br>As a supplier of only certified beans, in the short and medium term, we will ensure that Farmers, Brokers and LBAs adopt best management practices and comply with traceability requirements at each stage in the supply chain ie harvesting, handling, marking, packaging, storage and transport.
The objective is to track all beans through the stages of production, processing and distribution.
To accomplish this, we have designed our traceability system with three distinctive characteristics: -
•	Information of when and where cocoa is moved and transformed
•	A system linking these data
•	Marking of the jutebags in which the beans are stored
